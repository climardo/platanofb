Congratulations to [this week's](https://www.draftkings.com/contest/gamecenter/82236369) winners:

{% include 2019-week-14.html %}

Now entering the winner's circle: __LoLoGREEN__! This week had some crazy high scoring games and everyone missed out on the highest scoring player: __Drew Bress__ (43.06 fpts $5,900). I'm surprised he wasn't this week's Sleeper, but then again I never even knew there was a player named __Boston Scott__ (24.8 fpts $3,000). __Jameis Winston__ (40.74 fpts $6,400) had himself a game and was the highest-scoring player to be drafted in the league, including a draft by __Dash7__ who placed second. 

Two weeks remaining... If you haven't notched a win, now is the time! As per usual, I've included some links below to help you with that and there are some more generic links on the [Help](/help) page. Good luck everyone!
