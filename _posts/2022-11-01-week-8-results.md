We're almost half way through the season now and two-thirds (12 of 19) of the members have placed in the top three at least once. Congrats this week to **Jekell P** and **DarbyDiaz3** for placing second and third, respectively. **Jekell P** was the only member to make the excellent decision to draft **D'Onta Foreman** (34.8 fpts $5,300) who was probably one of the best salary per fpts RB picks of the week (I'm too lazy for math right now to say for certain). And **DarbyDiaz3** was one of only two members to add **A.J. Brown** (42.6 fpts $7,700) - the week's top-scoring WR. I (**climardo**) drafted **Alvin Kamara** (42.8 fpts $7,100), the week's MVP, along with some other top-tier players and was able to get another first place win.

Congratulations to the whole league for drafting the top 11 players of Week 8! The highest scoring player that we let slip was **Kyler Murray** (29.64 fpts $7,500) and that's probably the best this league has done in a while. You're putting in the effort and it shows! **Tyler Conklin** (25.9 fpts $3,200) flew under the radar to become the highest-scoring TE and Sleeper. Meanwhile, the Saints snapped **Davante Adams** (1.2 fpts $8,600) streak of 81 games with multiple catches and made him the Bust of the week, sorry **MattyDel14**.
