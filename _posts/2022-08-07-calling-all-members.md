Welcome back to another season of fantasy football! I hope 2022 will be fun and we can spread the wins out more than we did last year. I have reahced out to all members from years past to figure out how many members we will have for the 2022 season. So far, we have 2 members who missed the 2022 season joining us again: **BrunoDiaz** and **C-Bail**. We might have 21 members, I'm waiting on two confirmations - you left me on read and you know who you are. Everyone else, thank you for replying in a timely manner. With more members, that means the winnings will go up a bit; the math is `First = 67%, Second = 22%, Third = 11%` rounded to nicer looking numbers. 

If you have any questions about the league or this season, please check out the [rules](/rules) or reach out to me. Once again, welcome back!
