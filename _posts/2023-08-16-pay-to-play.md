Let's goooo!!! Every 2022 member is back for the 2023 NFL season and we even **added three more**. As a result, weekly payouts will be as follows:

- 1st: $40
- 2nd: $19
- 3rd: $9

Please submit your 2023 member fee before the season kicks off. Different payment methods can be found on the [rules](/rules) page and I've added Bitcoin as an option this year. And if you're already trying to concieve of your week 1 lineup, take a look at this article: [NFL DFS\: Way Too Early Look at DraftKings Salaries for Week 1 (Fantasy Football)](https://www.thefantasyfootballers.com/dfs/nfl-dfs-way-too-early-look-at-draftkings-salaries-for-week-1-fantasy-football-2/).

22 days left until kickoff. About 3 weeks... I'm hanging in but I'm eager af. FOOTBALL!!!
