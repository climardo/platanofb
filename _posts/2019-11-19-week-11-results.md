Congratulations to [this week's](https://www.draftkings.com/contest/gamecenter/80661195) winners:

{% include 2019-week-11.html %}

In the past five weeks, __glopez28__ has placed 1st, 2nd and 3rd in that order, although not consecutively, with the latter occurring this week. Impressive. __Philip Rivers__ (19.12 fpts $5,800) and __Hunter Henry__ helped him edge out __Halvworld__ by less than 3 fpts. __rogdiaz__ also swapped places with __DarbyDiaz3__ thanks to __Austin Ekeler__ (24.2 fpts $5,300) who scored 2.1 fpts with 41 seconds to go in the game, even though a subsequent pass to him was intercepted and lost the game for his team.

Only 5 more weeks left in our fantasy football season and there are still 6 members who have not yet placed. I would like to see everyone in the money at some point, so keep trying. Last week I sent out a link by text message to a resource tha could be helpful when drafting your lineups: [DraftKings NFL Game Logs](https://rotogrinders.com/game-stats/nfl?site=draftkings) from [Rotogrinders](https://rotogrinders.com). It let's you sort players by stats like targets and yardage. There's also [DraftKings NFL Lineup Optimizer](https://www.rotowire.com/daily/nfl/optimizer.php?site=DraftKings) by [RotoWire](https://www.rotowire.com) which biulds a lineup for you after you've selected at least two players to either include or exclude from your team. The first tool give you an easier way to analyze data while the second sort of takes control and gives you a team using who knows what math. Your mileage with each may vary. 

Anyway, good luck to everyone this week. Commissioner Maduro, out!

Week 12 Bye teams: Kansas City, LA Chargers, Minnesota, Arizona
