With 196.32 fpts, **hlimardo** won by more than 50 fpts! Congratulations to you, **glopez28** and **ejmesa**, the newest members to join this season's winner's circle. **hlimardo** put together quite a lineup by stacking some cheaper options from the #1 offense Lions who really paid off including **Jared Goff** (37.22 fpts $5,900), **Jamaal Williams** (26.9 fpts $6,100) and **Josh Reynolds** (21.1 fpts $4,600). Williams wasn't really a secret and made it into the lineups of 7 other members. Only **Khalil Herbert** (11.1 fpts $5,700) was more drafted this week. And somehow Goff's salary remains supressed at just $6,100 for Week 5. Choose wisely when creating your lineups!

Another stud from the Lions, **T.J. Hockenson** (42.9 fpts $4,100), was this week's MVP and Sleeper. Major value if you were one of the two members to draft him. One player that everyone missed was **Josh Jacobs** (37.5 fpts $5,500) who scored the second-most fpts of all players in Week 4. There was value all over the place if you knew where to look. Week 5 will probably be more of the same with more players getting injured and some recovering and returning to their teams. Their salaries might be out of line with their production and that's a strategy you may want to employ. Either way, [submit your lineup](/submit) for Week 5 and good luck!
