<p>I finally got around to adding the stuff from last year including the final results pages from 2018 and 2017 seasons. Those can be found in <a href="/stats.html">Stats</a>. The <a href="/resources.html">Resources</a> page has also been updated with lists of Twitter, Reddit and website links. If you have other stuff you want me to add, <a href="/assets/images/carlos-limardo.vcf">send me those links</a>.</p>
<p>This week, I also sent a link to this website to everyone in my WhatsApp broadcast list. If you're not on WhatsApp, you're not in that list and I reached out to you individually. You can start submitting your membership fee for this year starting now. Fees must be paid before 2019 NFL season kickoff on Thu Sep 9, 2015 8:20pm ET.</p>
<p> I also want to test out this chatroom feature, I'd like a place to talk trash each week outside of the DraftKings chat, because that thing sucks and as a result, I think no one likes to use it. So give the chat below a try. If it works, it will stick around for next week. Thanks all!</p>
