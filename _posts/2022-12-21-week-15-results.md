Congratulations to this week's winners, all returning for a second or sixth (ðŸ˜³) time.

There are just two weeks left with Christmas and New Year's Day landing on the next two Sundays. This Sunday there will be just three games, with the majority of Weke 16 games being played on Christmas Eve so keep that in mind when you create your lineup. Merry Christmas to all and good luck drafting!
