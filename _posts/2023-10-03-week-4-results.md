Congratulations to **JekellP** on finishing in first place for a second time, already. Three ‚ùÑÔ∏è players? No problem! Three üî• players including **Brandon Aiyuk**, **Nico Collins** and **Terry McLaurin** balanced that out and helped **JekellP** accumulate 163.46 fpts for the win in Week 4. **DarbyDiaz3**, another team with two of aformentioned players, was a close second place. And **GeeDee3** hung in there with **Lamar Jackson**, **De'Von Achane** and **DJ Moore** to cap off the winners this week.

Sometimes, players are worth their incredibly high salary as **Christian McCaffrey** proved this week. He probably should have tallied another touchdown, but the coaches were trying to spread the endzone celebrations at that point and let **Brock Purdy** walk one in. In a traditional league, I streamed my quarterback this week and picked up **Daniel Jones**... even with **Geno Smith** as my original choice, this was a bad move. This week's slepeer, **Seahawks DST**, sacked the Giants' QB 11 times and  scored on a 97-yard pick-6. **Deebo Samuel**'s assistance was not requested often by the Niners this week and he earned the title of Bust. **A.J. Brown** returned to putting on a 2022-like performance, but everyone was busy drafting **D'Andre Swift** and (36%) and **Adam Thielen** (27%) and missed it.

Lineup options condense as bye-weeks start now in Week 5. Good luck, get different and rack up those fpts.
