Congratulations to **g_mendoza** for the first win of their season. Drafting **Vikings**, this week's Sleeper, helped to separate from the rest of the pack, including me in second place. **rahianr** earned the third spot and their first win in the league, welcome! Both second and third place lineups pinned their hopes to **Cooper Kupp** who did not disappoint in the late Sunday game with 30.8 fpts comprised of 7 catches for 148 yards and a touchdown.

And more than half of the league drafted this week's MVP, **Raheem Mostert**. Guess which half? 8 of the top 10 lineups had Mostert. The 49ers suffered some injuries this past weekend, including Bust **Deebo Samuel**. Hope he and the rest of the injured league recover and return to form ASAP. And who was on no one's radar? **Jared Goff**. We all slept on him like a rainy Saturday morning. Now, it's time to wake up and get ready for another week of fantasy football and correct your mistakes. Only 13 games this week, with 6 teams on bye including Panthers, Bengals, Cowboys, Texans, Jets and Titans. Get those picks right and good luck!
