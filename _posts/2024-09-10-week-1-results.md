We're officially back! Thanks to all of the members for getting the fees in without too much hassle for me. Thanks to almost all of the members for submitting your lineups and keeping the contest interesting. Don't expect more than 1 reminder from me Thursdays. Set your own reminders, "Siri, remind me to set my lineup every Thursday afternoon". It works!

Anyway, congratulations to this week's winner, **g_mendoza** who crushed the competition with 178.56 fpts! In distamt second place, **MattyDel14** put up an impressive 157.48 fpts and **ejmesa** rounds out the winners as his Goya beans just simmer. Not a lot of overlap up here - everyone just put together some cool teams and maybe covered their eyes as they watched their tight ends fail.

I drafted **Saquon Barkley** (36.2 fpts $7,000) and thought I was so smart after Friday night. Then the rest of the games happened and my team humbled me quickly. No one touched picked up this week's Sleeper, but apparently **Aaron Rodgers** (QB27 !!!) loves **Allen Lazard ðŸ¦Ž** (26.9 fpts $3,000) and peppered him with 9 targets including 2 balls that made it into the end zone. **Joe Mixon** looked like his 2023-RB4-self and moved the ball on the ground for 159 yards, but no one in this league got any points for that.

Are y'all happy that football is back? I am. Let's fn go!!! Week 2. [Submit your lineup!](/submit)
