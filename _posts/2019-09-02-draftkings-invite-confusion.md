I'm sorry for the barrage of invites that have gone out over the past few days. Use the [Submit lineup <i class="fas fa-football-ball"></i>](https://www.draftkings.com/draft/contest/75607984) link in the nav menu to make sure you're submitting to the correct contest. If you've submitted to another contest, please withdraw your entry so that those contests will stop automatically re-running each week. Here's how:

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md border rounded p-2 m-1 text-center">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/withdraw-1.jpg"/>
            <small>Open DraftKings app, select Upcoming, select the contest</small>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md border rounded p-2 m-1 text-center">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/withdraw-2.jpg"/>
            <small>Select your entry</small>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md border rounded p-2 m-1 text-center">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/withdraw-3.jpg"/>
            <small>Select the menu (&#8942;)</small>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md border rounded p-2 m-1 text-center">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/withdraw-4.jpg"/>
            <small>Select Withdraw Entry</small>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md border rounded p-2 m-1 text-center">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/withdraw-5.jpg"/>
            <small>Select Withdraw Entry again to confirm</small>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Also, thank you to everyone who has submitted their membership fee. I will be reaching out to those who have not. If you have any questions about the DraftKings contests or anything else in this league, please [contact me](/assets/images/carlos-limardo.vcf).
