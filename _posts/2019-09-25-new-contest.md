Got tired of waiting for DraftKings to automatically generate the contest for Week 4, so I created a new one. Use the [Submit Lineup](https://www.draftkings.com/draft/contest/77132994) to submit your lineup. If you've submitted your lineup elsewhere, please withdraw it so that the contest will not automatically generate again. We may need to deal with DraftKings' auto-generated contest this week and next. Going forward, however, I will create contests manually because:

* DraftKings has been unreliable in automatically generating new contests this season
* We can set the contest name each week
* Contests can be generated earlier than before
* Thanksgiving and other weeks can cause problems due to games being played on different days or at different times

And probably some more stuff I haven't thought of. But anyway, you will get an invite each week, just like you did this week. And as always, you can come to [Platanofb.com](https://platanofb.com) for the link. Another thing worth mentioning: A link to stream Red Zone will be displayed in the menu every Sunday. If there are any issues with it, please [reach out to me](/assets/images/carlos-limardo.vcf). Thanks all for your patience and continued participation in this league. Good luck in Week 4!
