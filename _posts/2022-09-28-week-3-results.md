A pretty good week of matchups in the NFL resulted in some new members joining the winner's circle this week as **JekellP** has a repeat, top performance - congratulations! **jlopez0809** was short 6.19 fpts, and although the lineup had more üî• players, it also had more ‚ùÑÔ∏è players too, including **Davante Adams** (14.2 fpts $8,400), the WR3 in salary terms who fell to WR34 if we're looking at fpts. **hlimardo** separated from the rest of the pack to secure a third place finish this week.

And look who's MVP and Draft Dodger again: **Lamar Jackson** (43.42 fpts $8,000). I guess no one believed that he can be worth his high salary, but now you'll need to pay even more if you want to become a believer in Week 4. **Mack Collins** (32.96 fpts $3,300) was a clear Sleeper and was drafted to **geedee3**'s lineup. It was definitely a boost that could have helped to propel **geedee3** into the money, but a lot of chalk just didn't hit, like **Dalvin Cook** (14.6 fpts $7,900) who was the second-highest drafted player behind **David Mongomery** (1.1 fpts $5,900) who also failed a lot of members after his knee failed him in the first quarter. That opened the door for **Khalil Herbert** (33.9 fpts $5,200) to pick up the slack and run the ball for 157 yards and 2 touchdowns in a win against the Texans.

Remember to wake up early this Sunday and tune into NFL Network to watch Vikings @ Saints in Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London. This will reduce the number of late afternoon games to just three. And don't forget to [submit your lineups](/submit) before kick off. Good luck!
