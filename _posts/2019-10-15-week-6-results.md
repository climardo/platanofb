Congratulations to [this week's](https://www.draftkings.com/contest/gamecenter/77994627) winners:

{% include 2019-week-6.html %}

After taking a week off from the top, __pshhidk__ returns to become the first two-time 1st place winner and he accomplished this with zero unique draft picks. __JekellP__ made a splash in his 2019 debut, coming in second. This week's contest was the first time we had 19 members. While that created more competition, it also increases cash winnings. Keep submitting those lineups and let's spread this money around.

After scoring just 1 TD in his first five weeks, __Stefon Diggs__ (46.5 fpts $5,900) went crazy and scored 3 TDs on 7 REC for 167 YARDS. Another surprising player was __Hunter Henry__ (33 fpts $3,600), this week's Sleeper. He scored 2 TDs and got exactly 100 YARDS to earn the bonus and boost his total fpts to 33. Keep looking for those sleepers and value picks when you're drafting. 

This week's Bye teams: Carolina, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Tampa Bay.
