It's that time of year again. The commissioners from all of your fantasy leagues are starting to organize for the start of a new season. I reached out to you all over a week ago and today I am reaching out again to really get things started by collecting the loot. ~~19~~ 20 people (including me) are returning to play this season. No new people and we lost 4 üòû. Maybe only 3, ~~but I'm still waiting to hear back from **jlopez0809** and you know he's a degenerate gambler (I mean this in the most loving way). If you see him, tell him to stop ignoring me.~~

Anyway, with less members the winnings go down a bit:

- 1st - $36 <small>~3.6% of all member fees</small></li>
- 2nd - $15 <small>~1.5% of all member fees</small></li>
- 3rd - $8 <small>~0.8% of all member fees</small></li>

If you want to win more money, than just win more games ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. But before you even think about that, [pay your membership fees!](/rules). Thanks for your time and participation. I'll reach out again before the season starts. Adios!

**UPDATE**

**jlopez0809** is in! The winnings have been adjust above and on the [Rules](/rules) page.
