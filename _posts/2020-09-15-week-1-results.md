It feels so good to finally be back. Week 1 is now officially in the books. Everyone in the league scored over 100 fpts, and 6 members scored above the average of 122.6 fpts - good job, everyone! 

##### Week 1 winners
1. **DarbyDiaz3** <small class="text-muted">153.00 fpts</small>
2. **rogdiaz** <small class="text-muted">146.50 fpts</small>
3. **Halvworld** <small class="text-muted">145.12 fpts</small>

An especially job well-done to **DarbyDiaz3** who put up 153 fpts to take first place for Week 1 behind solid performances from the unique picks of **Jamison Crowder** (27.5 fpts $5,200) and **Robert Woods** (20.9 fpts $6,500). I wish I could say more but [live.draftkings.com](live.draftkings.com) is messing up and I don't feel like combing through the data so this will be it until DraftKings gets their act together. Next week's contest is live, use the [Submit lineup <i class="fas fa-football-ball"></i>](https://www.draftkings.com/draft/contest/92071738) link in the navigation menu to get started. Good luck ya'll!
