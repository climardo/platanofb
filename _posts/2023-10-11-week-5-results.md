When you draft two players who go off for more than 100 fpts combined, you're probably going to do pretty well. **pshhidk** did *really* well and scored 217.46 fpts, the highest score the league has ever seen, beating the previous record of 213.84 fpts set in 2019 Week 9 by **Dash7**. Speaking of, **Dash7** finished third for the third time this season. And **jlopez0809** came in second with some great, less-drafted players like **Justin Fields**, **Zack Moss**, and **Dalton Schultz**.

The two players I mentioned at the top of this post were this week's MVP and Sleeper: **Ja'Marr Chase** and **DJ Moore**. They each scored three touchdowns and moved the ball over 190 yards. **DeVonta Smith**  has cooled off in recent weeks following a hot start to the season, averaging just four receptions and 37 yards over his last three contests and earning the title of Bust. And **Travis Etienne** ran for over 100 yards for the first time since week 1, which is probably why he was overlooked and was this week's Draft Dodger.

Good luck in Week 6. I misnamed the contest. Sorry. I'll get it right for Week 8. For now, [submit your lineup](/submit).
