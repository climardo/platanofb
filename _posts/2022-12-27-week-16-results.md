I went to sleep thinking that I had won this week, patted myself on the back and even bragged to my wife who gave me smile and a nod to shut me up. And today I woke up excited to write this post and humbly accept another win, only to find that **Dash7** snuck in and took first place with the help of **Austin Eckler** (23.9 fpts $8,300) and **Chargers** (20 fpts $2,900)! Back-to-back first place wins - congrats **Dash7**! **luisdello** notched another third place finish to round out this week's winners.

I did, however, accomplish something else this week: superlatives are back! Check them out below. And finally, we are down to our final week on this league's fantasy football season. I hope you've all had fun. If you know people who might be interested in joining our league next year, tell them to check out this site and let me know so that I can send them an invite. If members decide to sit out next season, it would be good to have someone to fill in and keep the league size and prizes close to where they've been. Anyway, good luck in the last week!
