Congratulations to **glopez28** for being the last winner of the season. You beat **hlimardo** by exactly 1 fpt. 11 more combined yards would have made the difference, or even just a reception for positive yardage. Oh well, maybe next season. **ejmesa** also went back to back in the third position to round out the top of the pack.

There were only two names that really seemed to matter this week: **Ja'Marr Chase** and **Joe BUrrow**. He doesn't have a profile pic on DraftKings yet, but he is this week's MVP, Sleeper and Draft Dodger. I drafted him last week and he put up less than half of what he did this week. It's enough to throw a tantrum, pads and jersey and just walk out of a stadium topless. But, I'll leave to to AB.

I hope you've all had a good, fun season. Thanks for playing. See you next season!
