Congratulations to [this week's](https://www.draftkings.com/contest/gamecenter/76052450) winners:

{% include 2019-week-2.html %}

If football is a game of inches, then fantasy football is a game of fractional fantasy points. This week, __XplicitK__ took 1st place by a margin of just 0.2 fpts over __Halvworld__. 3 of 4 of __XplicitK__'s unique picks, __Davante Adams__ (20.6 fpts $7,700), __Christian Kirk__ (20.4 fpts $4,500) and __Travis Kelce__ (26.7 fpts $7,300), put up over 100 yds of offense. No one picked this week's MVP/Sleeper, which also made him this week's draft dodger: __DeMarcus Robinson__ (38.2 fpts $3,500) and I think he really surprised us all. Expect his price to go up for Week 3.

I expected to list __Patriots__ (37 fpts $3,700) as the Sleeper this week, but they'll have to be happy with just their shutout for now. Dolphins play at Cowboys in Week 3... just saying! There were a bunch of injuries this week too, so keep an eye out for all of those announcements in the [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/carloslimardo/lists/fantasy-football) on the homepage. Week 3 link will go up as soon as the contest is generated by DraftKings. Thanks for stopping by. Good luck in Week 3!
