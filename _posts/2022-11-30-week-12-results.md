Congratulations to a new winner: **BrunoDiaz**! Everyone was wondering which players were remaining in that lineup and probably got worried when they saw **Jonathan Taylor** (18.8 fpts $7,900). Along with the help of **Pat Freiermuth** (6.9 fpts $4,000), they added enough points to put **BrunoDiaz** ahead of **geedee3** for first and second place respectively. **arianna29** also returned to the top three for a league-leading **\*FIFTH\*** time! A job well done by all of the winners.

I still haven't worked out a new method for generating the weekly superlatives, but I've got something brewing. For now, I'll hit you with some interesting stats in the form of tweets:
