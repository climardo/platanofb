Congratulations to [this week's](https://www.draftkings.com/contest/gamecenter/81196189) winners:

{% include 2019-week-12.html %}

This week, __olivadotij__ finally earned his first 1st place win of the season and __glopez28__ placed for the third consecutive week. Both members have placed four times and __XplicitK__ joined the winner's circle for his third time in 2019. And if we're talking about bragging rights, these three have scored the most total points this season with __glopez28__ ahead of __olivadotij__ and __XplicitK__ by 34.36 and 45.32 fpts. You can check out the numbers and other league stats on [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XT31vsZxNVIHBnjh06C5_ldHVaeb3wnXAmOGcfci79k/edit?usp=sharing).

That's it for bye weeks. You can now draft from the full list of 1,696 players (assuming they're not injured or otherwise undraftable). __However__, this week is a bit peculiar since there will be two afternoon games on Thursday and our Thursday - Monday contest will not include them. I was hoping that DraftKings would change that this season, but no luck. Our season will end with week 16, leaving 4 more weeks (including this week 13) to win some money and earn some the right to talk smack throughout the NFL playoffs and off-season. Good luck to everyone. Commissioner Maduro, out!
