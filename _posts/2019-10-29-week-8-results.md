Congratulations to [this week's](https://www.draftkings.com/contest/gamecenter/78922851) winners:

{% include 2019-week-8.html %}

There are now 5 members with over $40 in total winnings this season; you can check them out [here](https://platanofb.com/results). The winners this week separated themselves from the rest of the pack by at least 13 fpts and all drafted __Mike Evans__ (45.8 fpts $6,600). We are half way through with this season and there are 7 members who have not placed yet. Keep submitting those lineups and try considering something new, like opponent rank against a position or weather conditions. Also, take a look at the analysis links posted [each week](#week-7-analysis) and the resources listed on [Help <i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://platanofb.com/help). You've got 8 weeks to shape up. Win first place each week and that's $280! You will probably also be called out as a cheater, because no one is that lucky, but hey - give it a try! 

I'm still waiting for DraftKings to allow Thursday - Monday contests like we've been doing. But I have been considering Sunday only contests for a while and some of you like this idea, although none of you have a problem with the current format. Let's take a vote (below). Good luck in Week 9. Maduro, out.

Week 9 Bye teams: Atlanta, Cincinnati, LA Rams, New Orleans
