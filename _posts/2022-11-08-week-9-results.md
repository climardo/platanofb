 Congratulations to **rogdiaz** and **arianna29** for placing first and second in Week 9. Neither member had any unique picks, but look at me (**climardo**) in third place and you will see that _unique_ players aren't always great nor necessary to get a W. Even without him in my lineup, I was excited to see **Joe Mixon** (58.1 fpts $6,500) shatter the 50 fpt mark - it's been too long since we've seen that and I was beginning to get concerned that we wouldn't see that at all this season. This is **rogdiaz** first time placing this season and he told me that it won't be his last. If you're tired of seeing the same members winning, then do whatever **rogdiaz** did and forge your wya to the top by making better choices.

When players meet their expectations, it doesn't matter if they're drafted by other members of the league because it is highly unlikely that two members would have identical matchups. Members can choose to get a little different, and in recent weeks members have been winning with players that analysts have mentioned in the week leading up to their games. These are the expectations that I speak of, not the "projected points" which is simply an average of a player's last 10 games. I am talking about the players that ESPN, NFL Network and podcasters hype up Monday through Saturday. In week 9, that included players like **Justin Fields** (45.72 $5,300), **Tyreek Hill** (30.3 fpts $8,500) and **Kenneth Walker** (30.9 fpts $6,200). And of course you can't fit every player into your lineup - that's what makes this game interesting.

Someone asked me what I've been doing differently this season and I told them: I've been listening to fantasy football podcasts daily to stay informed. I'll link the ones that I'm listening to down below. Check them out, maybe they will help you too. Good luck and happy drafting!
