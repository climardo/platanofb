Congratulations to **LoLoGREEN** on his first place win, beating **DarbyDiaz3** by just 0.4 fpts! **LoLoGREEN** won thanks to the contributions of **Dak Prescott** (43.80 fpts $6,800) and **Calvin Ridley** (32.90 fpts $6,800), and he was the only person to draft **Tyler Higbee** (28.40 fpts $4,700) - a masterful pick at TE.

Dak was by far the most drafted player (7 of 17) and with good reason - he threw for a mind-boggling 450 yds and ran it in for 3 TDs, making him the highest scoring QB of the week, but falling short of MVP by less than 5 fpts. The honor of MVP goes to **Aaron Jones** (48.60 fpts $7,100) who had over 200 all-purpose yards punctuated by 3 TDs of his own.

A lot of players, however, didn't make it out of Week 2 unscathed. ESPN listed some of [the most impactful injuries of Week 2](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/page/billbarnwell092120/ranking-most-impactful-injuries-nfl-week-2-nick-bosa-saquon-barkley-drew-lock-more). It was really a sad and crazy week for the NFL, but on the bright side - no reported COVID-19 results from Week 1 and that's a huge positive. There are 16 games in Week 3 starting this Thursday. Keep the injuries in mind and find those sleepers - there are likely to be a lot of them with more backups playing a starting role. Good luck in Week 3!
