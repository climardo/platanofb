Well, that was a decent week of football to kick off the 2023 NFL and Platanofb season. I took the win this week thanks to **Tyreek Hill** and **Austin Ekler**, but I was sweating it out as **hlimardo** had **James Cook** playing last night. **JekyllP** was also in the running and was the only member to draft **Brandon Aiyuk** who was WR2 for the week at a much lower cost than WR1 - (35.9 fpts $4,900 vs 47.5 fpts $8,200). This week's winners separated from the rest of the pack by over 15 fpts. The rest of the league better bring some more luck with them next week.

I heard a stat that total number of touchdowns for week 1 has been declining and that was pretty evident with the scoring we saw over the weekend. **Titans** and **Saints** combined to kick eight total field goals, which is an NFL record for Week 1, and means absolutely nothing in this league. Please leave your kickers at home, that's not what we're here for. Defenses, however, are a part of DFS, and the **Cowboys** were this week's Sleeper. The stats are ridiculous, so [check em out below](#sleeper-most-fpts-per-salary). **Chiefs** receivers disappointed everyone, especially **Patrick Mahomes** and **frank.corn** as **Kadarius Toney** earned the title Bust for this week. And everyone forgot about **Tua Tagovailoa** who's 466 passing yards are the fourth-most ever by any quarterback in Week 1.

Time to put this behind us and look forward to week 2. [Submit](/submit) your lineups and remember that you can always go back and make changes as long as that player's game hasn't started.

Commissioner Maduro, hasta la proxima!
