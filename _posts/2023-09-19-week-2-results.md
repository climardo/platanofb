Sorry for the delayed results post, but you know - life. Anyway, that was a crazy week and overall we had much higher scores this week compared to last. Leading it all was **JekellP** with 187.54 fpts thanks to WR3 **Mike Evans** who was unique to this lineup. **Hunter Henry** was another nice add and showed up in only one other lineup: **BrunoDiaz** who claimed second place in Week 3 with the super value pick of **Kirk Cousins** - quietly QB1 so far in 2023, followed by **Russell Wilson** (Draft Dodger). This season has been so weird and riddled with injuries. And rounding out the top 3 is **Dash7** with week 3's RB2 **Brian Robinson Jr.** and RB3 **Raheem Mostert**. That was 57.6 fpts for just $11,000 salary in just two positions. Keep finding these diamonds in the rough.

Football is brutal. We saw what happened to **Nick Chubb** and hope he has speedy, painless recovery. And a bunch of other players left games with injuries or in concussion protocol. Now, you may have to pay more attention to who is playing or getting scratched if you want avoid ❄️ in your lineup. And as gross as it may seem, even **Mac Jones** is QB7 on the season and **JekellP** just won with him, so let's set our priors aside when [drafting our teams for week 3](/submit). Good luck everyone!
