Congratulations to one of our new members, **itsmeyo**, for taking the top spot this week, thanks in part to being the only team with **Keenan Allen** - WR1 on the week with disgusting numbers that would typically earn a player #1 overall, but not this week. **MattyDel14** came in second with a lineup that didn't feature any high-scoring unique picks, but the combination was unique and good enough to best 21 other members. And finally, **Dash7** returns for back-to-back third place finishes with a roster full of unique and less-picked players, like **Jared Goff**, **D'Andre Swift** and **Tutu Atwell**, who had good games.

I missed a good portion of this week's games and luckily one of those was Cowboys @ Cardinals. WTF was that? Moving on, I, like the **Broncos**, missed **De'Von Achane**'s monster performance which included over 200 yards of offense and 4 touchdowns! Aaaand nobody had the MVP and Draft Dodger in their lineup, phew ðŸ˜…. Three members had the sense to play the **Bills**, while the rest of us slept on them. I knew it was going to be a crazy week, but I didn't expect Miami RBs to score almost 90 fpts combined at only $11,000 salary! Anyway, [submit your lineup](/submit) for week 4 and good luck!
