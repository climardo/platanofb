Thank you all for deciding to play fantasy football once again for the 2020 NFL season. I will generate the first week's contest as soon as I possibly can so that you can start stressing out, submit your "winning" lineups and then return 27 times before Thursday Night Kickoff to make changes. 

This year some members decided not to return and we added one new member bringing our total to 17. I did some math and figured what I thought would be best for weekly prize moneys would be as follows; first: $30, second: $15, third $8. This leaves a remainder of $2 which I will send to the player with the most total fantasy points at the end of the season.

2020 will be a weird NFL season just like we've seen for MLB and NBA. Of course there is the possibility that the season will end before our 16 week run, and if that happens then you will receive a prorated refund of membership fee, see [Rules <i class="fas fa-gavel"></i>](/rules.html) for details. Of course we all hope that doesn't happen, but I want to be prepared. Speaking of membership fees, please remember to submit yours using any of the payment methods also listed on [Rules <i class="fas fa-gavel"></i>](/rules.html). If you haven't paid, your name is in this list:

If you paid recently and your name is still on this list, then you should reach out to get me to do my job to update it. I hope you and your families are all safe and healthy. I look forward to another season of fantasy football. Commissioner Maduro, out!
