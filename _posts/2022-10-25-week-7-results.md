Week 7 brought us a bunch of high scoring players and return to the top 3 for **jlopez0809** (2x), **geedee3** (2x) and **glopez28** (4x!!!). At this point, **glopez28** has won more than lost. Maybe I'll stop sending reminders to submit lineups to give others a chance. A common draft pick by all three (and half of the league)? **Kenneth Walker** (31.8 fpts $5,800). Apparently a necessary pick for top 3 consideration.

Other notable players this week include **Joe Burrow** (42.24 fpts $6,900) -- MVP, **Juwan Johnson** (20.2 fpts $2,700) -- Sleeper and **Andy Dalton** (32.54 fpts $5,100) -- Draft Dodger. It looks like the choice for top QBs keeps changing as we went from Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen earlier in the season and now should probably consider Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes every week too. Defenses have bene scoring high too and only got squeezed out of the Sleeper position this week thanks to a surprise from Juwan Johnson. But then again, the Browns showed everyone that anything can happen in any game so maybe none of these stats or trends matter. If there wasn't _some_ skill involved in drafting then I don't think **glopez28** would be back in the top 3 every week. So figure out what they're doing and do it better. Good luck!
