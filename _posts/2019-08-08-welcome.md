If you didn't realize, the site has moved from <del>platanofootball.com</del> to platanofb.com - it's less typing. The rules from last year are the same and you can check those out by hitting the Rules link in the navigation menu. I'll post more in this very post tomorrow morning, but for now I just wanted to get this site up and running. Thanks for visiting and enjoy!
