Fall is in the air and that means it's time for football! Welcome back to Platanofb and congratulations to **arianna29** for crushing it to kickoff the season! **arianna29** was the only member to draft **Ja'Marr Chase** (31.9 fpts $7,100) and  **Dolphins DST** (18 fpts $2,600), 2 of 5 ðŸ”¥ players in the winning lineup. **g_mendoza** finished in second ahead of **geedee3** by less than half a point.

Everyone faded Justin Jefferson (42.4 fpts $7,800), probably scared off by his salary, but he showed up and was this week's MVP. Steelers (26 fpts $2,600) were this week's sleeper and nobody drafted them, but the most drafted player this week, Michael Pittman Jr. (30.1 fpts $5,500), was a value that almost half of the league spotted and added to their lineups. Another notable player this week, Geno Smith (17.2 fpts $5,100), had the chats buzzing last night, but ultimately scored a very average 17.2 fpts.

Thanks for coming back for another season of this league. Don't forget to join the converstaion at [#trashtalk](https://discord.gg/AKDJNmKmJK) on Discord. And [submit your lineup](/submit) early. Or last minute. Whatever, as long as you do it. Good luck!
