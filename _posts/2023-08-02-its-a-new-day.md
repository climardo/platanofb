HOT DAMN! It's a new day!!! More like a new season, but whatever, it works. Welcome back everyone! I'm glad you're here and have decided to suffer through another grueling, fun season of fantasy football with your fellow platanos. Yesterday, August 1st, I sent out text messages to looking for replies to see who is interested in playing again this season. Of 2022's 19 members, 14 have said they will return and I recruited a new member who is new to daily fantasy football. I expect beginner's luck to bless their lineups and overconfidence to destroy mine, but let's see what happens. I'm not interested in introducing any new [rules](/rules) or anything, but if you have any ideas please reach out to me. When I'm certain about the members for this season I will reach out again and start reminding y'all to submit your member fees, but there is nothing for you to do until then. Check the [help](/help) page for resources to stay up-to-date. Good luck!
