Congratulations to this week's winners. All of this week's winners have only appeared at the top of the leaderboard once earlier this season, in weeks 11, 4 and 9, respectively. Good to see newish names up here, but not as good as seeing brand new names. Next week is the final week of the season!

Everyone slacked on drafting **Tee Higgins** or **Isaiah McKenzie**, this week's MVP and Sleeper. But we all faded **Chuba Hubbard**, this week's Bust, and you can at least pat yourselves on the back for that one. Week 17 starts on Sunday so you have more time to draft your team. 

I messed up last week and didn't update the [submit](/submit) link and then spammed everyone about submitting a lineup on Thursday evening before kickoff because I was having issues figuring out who hadn't submitted. Sorry for both things. The problems are gone and soon, the season will be too. I hope you've had fun playing this season, even if you didn't win. Remember to stop by the [#trashtalk](https://discord.gg/AKDJNmKmJK) on Discord if you want to talk some smack or see how hype others are about their teams before kickoff and how sad/angry they are by 2pm on Sunday.

I've had fun this season and after finally placing this week, I'll look forward to next season. Happy New Year!
