If at first you get second place, come back next week and get first. That's what **arianna29** did, as she took won while likely sweating **XplicitK**'s late come back with **Darrel Williams** on Sunday night and then **Tyler Higbee** on Monday night who dropped too many, very catchable passes. I'm sure it was frustrating to watch, as I also lost in a different league due to the Rams, and more specifically Higbee's horrible performance. At least he found the end zone this week ðŸ¤·. **geedee3** also placed in consecutive weeks, landing in third after reconsidering some lineup changes and ultimately settling on the right choice of **Stefon Diggs**. Don't worry, there was no collusion, in fact this was discussed after the games started in [#TrashTalk on Discord](https://discord.gg/AKDJNmKmJK). Join us whenever games are on.

And then there were the players that nobody picked so they made the superlatives because that's been the theme of this league. **Patrick Mahomes** was the MVP as he got back to being the player we expected him to be the whole first half of the season, but we only saw him play like this about a quarter of the season so far. Will he keep it up in Week 11 against this week's Sleeper, **Cowboys**. For the fourth week in a row, the title of Sleeper goes to DST. I might have to tweak how this is calculated or DraftKings may need to change their pricing. Cowboys will play the Chiefs at Kansas City in what is currently projected to be the highest scoring matchup of the week; it should be fun to watch. 

Submit your lineups early and give yourselves time to change them before Sunday when the bulk of players kickoff and more news will have come out regarding injuries and other player statuses. Good luck to everyone who hasn't won yet and worst of luck to those who keep winning.
