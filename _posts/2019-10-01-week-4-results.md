Congratulations to [this week's](https://www.draftkings.com/contest/gamecenter/77132994) winners:

{% include 2019-week-4.html %}

__Chris Godwin__ (44.2 fpts $6,000) made my job of listing the MVP, Sleeper and Draft Dodger this week easy. But it's players like this that also make playing fantasy football fun. I doubt that anyone expected __Buccaneers__ (15 fpts $2,100) to play so well against __Rams__ (6 fpts $3,900), but the game ended with an amazing score of 55 - 40 with __Jameis Winston__ (33.3 fpts $5,700) throwing for 4 TD, including two to the aformentioned Godwin.

__pshhidk__ got the win after putting up serious points with his TNF picks of __Aaron Rodgers__ (30.48 fpts $6,000) and __Davante Adams__ (31 fpts $7,500), a combo that is sure to go off again this season, and his early Sunday picks of __Austin Eckler__ (29.2 fpts $8,000) and __Jarvis Landry__ (27.7 fpts $5,100). He kicked back after that and didn't need _or get_ a single point from __Rashaad Penny__ ($4,200) or __Devin Smith__ ($3,900).

Let's also remember that the __Browns__ (10 fpts $2,500) upset the __Ravens__ (-1 fpts $3,200). So continue to expect the unexpected and look for those Sleepers. Good luck to you in Week 5!
