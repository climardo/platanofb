Welp, I figured it would happen at some point and I guess that point was yesterday. DraftKings was hacked and as a result they bolstered their security and broke the code that I was using to generate the stuff you've been seeing in these posts like weekly winners, MVP, Sleeper, Draft Dodger and Bust. I don't think I am going to get that working again, so that's done for now. If you keep any money on DraftKings platform or if you want to be safe anyway, please update your password and don't reuse passwords.

Anyway, congratulations to **pshhidk**, first time placing and first overall for Week 11. Five members, including **pshhidk** made what I called a "big brain move" by drafting **Daniel Jones** (29.64 fpts $5,700), an excellent value in an important position which was much cheaper than **Justin Fields** (23.62 fpts $7,600) who finally came back down to earth after his salary had finally risen to the match the level he was playing it in the past 4 weeks. Another great pickup was **Travis Kelce** (38.5 fpts $8,000) - pricey, but worth it. **JekellP** and **g_mendoza** also returned to the top 3 to claim some more cash. 

Anyway, I wish you all good luck in Week 12. And I'll leave you with some other observations I made this week:
> Austin Hooper and Treylon Burks were actually great choices last night. Only @Gee drafted Hooper and no one drafted Burks. Each catch is a big deal for these low-salary, punt plays.

> Derrick Henry had a modest performance, but was just 13 rushing yards shy of the 3 fpts bonus and 1 receiving TD away from the hat trick that Joe Mixon pulled off a few weeks ago. I'll add, he had 28 carries ðŸ˜³ which is 22% above his average. And scored almost 4 fpts over his expectation. Not a bad pickup, but not the big pay off you want from $8,100 salary.
