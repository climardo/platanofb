After some changes due to COVID-19 and DraftKings decision to exclude KC and NE players, we conclude another week of daily fantasy football. This week's winner: **rogdiaz** is no stranger to the winner's circle and snatched first place from **XplicitK** by less than 2 points. And, making sure people remember his name, **DarbyDiaz3** remained a top 3 member, too.  

##### Week {{ page.week }} winners <small class="text-muted">[Contest details](https://www.draftkings.com/contest/gamecenter/{{weekly.contest_id}})</small>
{% for member in weekly.members limit:3 %}
1. **{{member.userName}}** <small class="text-muted">{{member.fantasyPoints}} fpts</small>{% endfor %}

**rogdiaz** was the only member to draft **Tom Brady** (36.36 fpts $6,100), **Adam Thielen** (29.20 fpts $6,600) and **Eagles** (18 fpts $2,600) who combined for almost 50% of his 172.26 fpts and only 30% of his salary cap. That's efficient. This week's MVP, **Joe Mixon** (45.1 fpts $5,800), wasn't even drafted and neither was the Sleeper, **Robert Tonyan** (33.8 fpts $3,400), although this was a much, much bigger surprise. He's currently trending as the most added player in traditional fantasy leagues even with a bye week coming up. 

As **DarbyDiaz3** and **rogdiaz** have shown us through 4 weeks, winning is not _all_ luck. If you haven't been scoring much, change your strategy. Check out the [Twitter list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/810471194399047680?s=20) on the home page or the other resources on the [Help](/help) page. I have also been posting some articles from professionals at the [bottom](#weekly-analysis-recap-and-advice) of each of these blog posts. Bye weeks start now, reducing the pool of players to draft. I would like to see all new top 3 next week - good luck everyone!

Bye week teams:
Lions, Packers
