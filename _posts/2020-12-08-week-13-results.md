Congratulations to this week's winner for the fourth time this season: **DarbyDiaz3**. This is also the [seventh time](/assets/images/2020/week-13-darbydiaz3.png) **DarbyDiaz3** has placed. A lot of haters are calling him a cheater, but I haven't been shown any evidence of that and with recent changes to contests for the past few weeks I find that more difficult to accomplish. Let's also congratulate **JekellP** who earned his first bit of the pot this week in third place. And **Dame7** was about 4 fpts shy of first place.

This week, **DarbyDiaz3** was the only memeber to draft the league's leading scorer: **Darren Waller** (48 fpts $6,100) which made up almost 27% of his total points. A lot of other random players went off too, including **Baker Mayfield** (33.46 fpts $5,300), this week's Draft Dodger.

Sorry for the super late post and the late contest creation. I was waiting for DraftKings to make a contest available with more games and finally Sunday-Monday (15 games) showed up. Start drafting, this is the third to last week!
