Congratulations to [this week's](https://www.draftkings.com/contest/gamecenter/76531512) winners:

{% include 2019-week-3.html %}

I, __climardo__, took first place this week, but lacked creativity. None of the players that I drafted were unique picks, but only __John Ross III__ (3.2 fpts $5,100) scored in the single-digits. And __Dash7__ had a chance to win with __Chris Thompson__ (14.8 fpts $4,500) late Monday night, but lost by only 1.48 fpts. Unfortunately, he went up against the best DST of the week, __Bears__ (21 fpts $3,900) who destroyed __Redskins__ with 4 SACK, 3 INT, 2 FUM REC and 1 TD. They were a great pick by __jlopez0809__, while everyone else (7 of 18) was still high on __Patriots__ (11 fpts $3,800).

This week saw an unexpected set of starting QBs, including New York's __Daniel Jones__ (39.24 fpts $5,000) who absolutely crushed it in his career debut. Thankfully the injuries this week were minimal, although this week's __Sleeper__ __Taylor Gabriel__ (32.2 fpts $3,600) did leave the game early with a concussion, but not before scoring 3 TD. This week 2 teams have a bye week: 49ers and Jets, so there will be less players to choose from and games to watch.
