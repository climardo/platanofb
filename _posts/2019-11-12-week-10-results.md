Congratulations to [this week's](https://www.draftkings.com/contest/gamecenter/80102460) winners:

{% include 2019-week-10.html %}

This week __DarbyDiaz3__'s team scored the most points this league has ever seen: 221.72. He had no unique picks, but every draft choice, with the exception of __David Montgomery__ (6 fpts $5,300), had a hot game and put up at least 19 points. This week's runner-up __glopez28__ has the most total ponts this season, 1529.80, followed by this week's third place winner, __olivadotij__. Total points doesn't count for anything but bragging rights, so brag on, talk your shit. 

The __Steelers__ (25 fpts $2,600) are back-to-back Sleeper of the week and went undrafted both times. They face the __Browns__ in week 11. 

Week 10 Bye teams: Green Bay, NY Giants, Seattle, Tennessee
