Commisisoner Maduro has arrived! Alright, enough about me. Congratulations to this week's other winners: **DarbyDiaz3** and **glopez28**, a couple of frequent visitors to the league's top three. The **Josh Allen** (30.36 fpts $8,200) and **Stefon Diggs** (33,8 fpts $8,400) stack paid off this week, but **Joe Burrow** (35.5 fpts $6,700) and **Ja'Marr Chase** (35.2 fpts $7,700) was the better, cheaper stack that put **DarbyDiaz3** in second place. And with less ðŸ”¥ players, **glopez28** was able to claim third place thanks to **Robert Tonyan** (19 fpts $3,600), the afformentioned Chase and a committee of decent performances.

This week's MVP was the reignited **Joe Burrow** (35.5 fpts $6,700) who set the field ablaze as he hit the 300+Pass bonus, 3 PaTD, and walked it across the line for another TD. Hopefully this version of Burrow is here to stay for the rest of the season. Another player who had yet to put on performances like he had last year was **Mike Gesicki** (24.9 fpts $3,100) -- this week's sleeper. His teammate, **Tyreek Hill** (32.7 fpts $7,500), helped to get the Dolphins down the field with his 12-177-0 line and also went undrafted in our league. 

The byes continue in week 7 as some good teams and the Rams get some time off. Sorry, you won't be able to draft anyone from the Vikings, Eagles or Bills. If you need some help with drafting your lineup, check the links below and the [Help](/help) page. Good luck!
