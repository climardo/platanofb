Congratulations to **MattyDel14** for placing for the first time in his first season of Platanofb! **JekellP** and **arianna29** each made their fifth and sixth(!!) appearances in the top after placing first and third, respectively, in Week 13. The trio of **Tony Pollard** (24.6 fpts $6,500), **Garrett Wilson** (27.2 fpts $5,300) and **Cowboys** (20 fpts $3,900) lit up **JekellP**'s lineup and lead to luminous threepeat on the season. None of them were the best performers in their position, but they all did well. **MattyDel14** was the only member to draft **Tyler Lockett** (30.8 fpts $6,000) and **arianna29** was the sole **Samaje Perine** (24.5 fpts $6,000) owner. Again, congrats to you three!

For those of you who are in traditional leagues, this week is likely the start of playoffs. Cheers for getting in if you did, and better luck next time if you didn't. And if you're not involved with any other leagues, then hopefully you can focus your time in the final month and last four weeks of Platanofb. Remember, Week 17 will be the last week, so if you're trying to reclaim some of your membership fees and haven't done so already, now is the time concentrate and get that W. Check the links below and those in [Help](/help) for some guidance. Get your lineup in early and make as many changes as you need to before each player's game kicks off. Buena suerte!
