Well, damn. Six players scored over 40 fpts this week and half of them were under $7,000. **JekellP** finished in first, **g_mendoza** repeated for second place and one of our new members, **luisdello** came in third. Every one of these members drafted one 40+ fpt player and **JekellP** claimed the highest bragging rights while also having four ❄️ players in their lineup. Not sure what that says about the league, but it doesn't seem like it would be anything good. Congratulations to the aformentioned members. Now that a quarter of our members have won some money, it's time for the rest to step up and claim some prizes, too!

Another week, another MVP undrafted. **Lamar Jackson** (48.62 fpts $7,400) played out of his mind with QB and RB stats that any member would have been glad to include in their lineup. And a DST earned Sleeper of the week *again*; this time it was **Jaguars** (21 fpts $2,300) with 5 sacks, 3 picks and a shutout of the Colts (0-1-1, just had to mention that). And the QB on the other side of the ball in the Ravens @ Dolphins game, **Tua Tagovailoa** (43.86 fpts $5,600) also went undrafted. The other four of the six players I alluded to above were drafted and all but **Jaylen Waddle** (43.1 fpts $6,400) contributed to the top 3 lineups.
