Congratulations to [this week's](https://www.draftkings.com/contest/gamecenter/79573034) winners:

{% include 2019-week-9.html %}

This week's recipe for the beans was finally right and earned __ejmesa__ his first win of the season. Other winners include __hlimardo7__ with his third second-place finish and __jlopez0809__ with his second third-place win. This week, __ejmesa__ went top heavy with his QB, RB, WR choices including __Russell Wilson__ (42.22 fpts $7,100), __Tyler Lockett__ (43.2 fpts $7,500) and __Ezekiel Elliott__ (16.9 fpts $8,900) totalling $23,500 - almost half of his team's entire salary. Even though Zeke didn't pan out, the strategy seemed to work. That leaves 4 members who haven't yet placed this season. You know who you are. Try harder and get this money.

There were 7 responses to last week's survery. As expected, most people want to keep the existing format:

And looking forward to Week 10, be aware there are a lot less players to choose from with six teams on bye. Good luck!

Week 10 Bye teams: Denver, Houston, Jacksonville, New England, Philadelphia, Washington
