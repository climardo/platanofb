Congratulations to [this week's](https://www.draftkings.com/contest/gamecenter/77994627) winners:

{% include 2019-week-7.html %}

__glopez28__ placed for the first time this season with the help of __Aaaron Rodgers__ (46.76 fpts $6,400) and __Marvin Jones__ (43.3 fpts $5,000), who also happened to be the top scoring players this week. __XplicitK__ and __jlopez0809__ both made their returns to the winners' circle this week and add to their season total cash winnings with picks including __Jared Goff__ (25.02 fpts $6,200) and __Dalvin Cook__ (30.9 fpts $8,000). After these 3 winners, everyone else was left in the dust, with 4th place (__olivadotij__) scoring just 145.5 fpts.

Please remember to submit to the correct contest this week. Once the auto-run contest goes unfilled for two weeks it will stop generating and there will be no more confusion. Until then, just use the [__Submit Lineup <i class="fas fa-football-ball"></i>__](https://www.draftkings.com/draft/contest/78922851) in the site menu. Good luck in Week 8! Commissioner Maduro, out.
