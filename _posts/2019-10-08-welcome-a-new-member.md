Everyone, please welcome __JekellP__. He decided to join us starting Week 6 and, like everyone else, paid the $50 membership fee. __This will increase the first place winnings from $30 to $35__, second and third place winnings remain unchanged. This also means a new contest must be started in order to accomodate an extra member. Please make sure you use the link on this site to [submit your lineup](https://www.draftkings.com/draft/contest/77994627). Also, please [withdraw your entry](https://platanofb.com/help#withdraw) from the DraftKings-generated ~~[contest](https://www.draftkings.com/draft/contest/77960083)~~ if you've already submitted one. You don't need to re-do your lineup though, you can simple [import](https://platanofb.com/help#import) it to the new contest. Thanks all and good luck in Week 6!
