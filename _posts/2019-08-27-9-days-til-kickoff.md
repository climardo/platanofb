The season is quickly approaching and it's still not fast enough. I reached out to everyone today as a reminder to submit your member fees and got some responses - thank you! If you haven't paid,please remember to pay before Thursday September 5, 2019 8:20 PM EDT. You can find a list of accepted payment services on the [Rules](/rules.html) page. If you have paid, and want to confirm that your payment was received, check the [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XT31vsZxNVIHBnjh06C5_ldHVaeb3wnXAmOGcfci79k/edit?usp=sharing) page - there will be a '1' in the Week 1 column next to members who have paid. 

I just want to get the bookkeeping out of the way so we can begin the season and start stressing out about our lineups while we eat wings and drink beer two Sundays from now. Let's gooo!!!
